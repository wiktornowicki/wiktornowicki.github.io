                <p>Hey, I'm Wiktor! I'm an n/b programming student from Poland, mainly focusing on web designing and GUI app designing. I am pretty much an amateur at this point, however I don't think I'll ever be more than that. I'm doing everything purely for fun, and of course, to help other people out. I'm trying to create my own programming language, and I suppose it'll take a while, but hey! It'll happen some day. My hobbies are pretty much nothing but playing RPGs/rhythm-based games, playing guitar and programming. Oh, yeah, and I make VMs.</p>
                <p>I'm doing my best to improve at these things, and I guess I'm getting somewhere. I mean, I made this page without using any external templates.</p>
                <p>If you find me on some crappy forum making fun of people or see me begging for VESA drivers for ancient Windows versions on BetaArchive, don't be surprised. It's a lifestyle. Well, that's about it for talking about me.</p>
                <p>I also am working on my own Linux distribution, which I codenamed "Prism Linux".</p>

                <p>This is the section in which I'll post occasional updates (by adding them to the bullet list). Hopefully through this you'll be able to find out where to look for a specific commit.</p>

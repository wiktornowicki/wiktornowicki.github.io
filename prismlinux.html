                <p>Prism Linux is a source-based Linux distribution, based on GNU C library (using LLVM POSIX extensions), compiled with the LLVM toolchain. It uses the pkgsrc package manager with Joyent repositories. It currently supports only x86_64 platforms, as it is the most commonly used processor architecture.</p>
                <p>The system itself uses the BusyBox userland/init system, with a few external dependencies. The default shell is GNU Bash, however it comes prebundled with Z Shell 5.4.2. It is meant to run LTS releases of the Linux kernel, for the sole reason of increased stability and, as the LTS suggests, more commonly available support.</p>
                <p>The general concept of the OS is heavily inspired by Gentoo Linux, as it is meant to be a source package-based distribution.</p>
                <p>User authentication and management rely on OpenPAM modules and libraries, as well as Shadow profile management. The installation tarball comes with <b>no</b> users predefined (aside from root), therefore we recommend running a chroot environment before the first boot. In the images repository, a chroot setup script will be provided for creating the environment.</p>
                <p>The installation process is really similar to the one for Gentoo - bind the virtual filesystems, chroot into the filesystem and install required packages. You can prepare the chroot environment by running the chroot script as follows (run as root/sudo): "./chroot-setup MOUNTPOINT=[insert your mount point here]", eg. "./chroot-setup MOUNTPOINT=/mnt".</p>
                <p>From there, you should just install your desired packages (an X host, basic use software, additional development tools etc.).</p>

				<p>Crystal is a material-pastel theme designed by a programming student for the simple, well-known IDE Notepad++. It's supposed to be a light-coloured soft theme, so if you're a programmer that likes dark themes (pretty much a generic person), and you're looking for something that won't blind you, this theme is for you!</p>
				<p>The theme was designed for Notepad++ v7.8.2, however it is updated pretty often, therefore you can be sure that it won't glitch itself out for no reason, as it is tested with each version.</p>

			<h2 class = "artHeader2">Supported languages</h2>
			<p>Crystal is a theme that is still a work-in-progress project. It is updated from time to time, either way you shouldn't expect it to be flawless. Nothing ever is perfect. Aaaaaand besides, I'm really lazy and tend to ignore some issues.</p>
			<p>Either way, I believe it would be nice to list the languages that are currently supported.</p>
